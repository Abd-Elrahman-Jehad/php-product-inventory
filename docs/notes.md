## Deployment Notes and Challenges

During the deployment of this project, several challenges were encountered while working with Git, Docker, and GitHub Codespaces. These challenges helped improve my understanding of containerization and deployment workflows.

### Docker Challenges

One of the biggest issues I faced was related to the Dockerfile itself. Initially, the Dockerfile was saved with a `.txt` extension, which prevented Docker from recognizing it correctly. This issue was resolved by renaming the file properly using Visual Studio Code and ensuring that the file name was exactly `Dockerfile` without any extension.

Another challenge involved Docker port mapping. At first, the application did not open in the browser because the selected port was already in use. This problem was fixed by stopping the running container and re-running it with the correct port mapping using Docker.

### Git and Repository Organization

Through this project, I learned the importance of organizing a professional GitHub repository. The source code was placed inside a `src/` directory to keep the project structure clean and organized. Additionally, a `.dockerignore` file was used to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the Docker image, which helped keep the image lightweight and efficient.

### GitHub Codespaces Issues

Another challenge was understanding how GitHub Codespaces handles port forwarding. The application did not open automatically at first, but after checking the **PORTS** tab and using the forwarded URL generated by Codespaces, the project became accessible through the browser.

There were also some difficulties related to Docker container management, such as rebuilding images and restarting containers. These issues were resolved by rebuilding the Docker image and running the container again in detached mode.

### Conclusion

Overall, these challenges significantly improved my understanding of Docker, container networking, GitHub version control, and deploying applications using GitHub Codespaces. The experience helped me gain practical knowledge of real-world deployment scenarios.
